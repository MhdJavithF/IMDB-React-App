# IMDB-React-App
For hosting purpose I used this repository with single commit. I completed this IMDB project in a week. Original codes path is [React-Js -> class-4 -> imdb] 


This project was a deep dive into modern React development, helping me apply and master essential concepts while delivering a feature-rich experience.

Key Features:
âœ… Searching, Filtering, and Sorting: Intuitive tools for users to find movies effortlessly.
âœ… Watchlist Management: Add and remove movies from your personalized watchlist.
âœ… Pagination: Smooth navigation through large datasets.

React Concepts Used:
ðŸ“Œ States & Props: To manage and pass dynamic data across components.
ðŸ“Œ useMemo & useCallback: For optimizing performance.
ðŸ“Œ useEffect & useRef: To handle lifecycle methods and DOM references.
ðŸ“Œ useParams & BrowserRouter: For seamless routing and parameterized navigation.
ðŸ“Œ localStorage: For persistent data management.
ðŸ“Œ React Icons: To enhance the UI/UX with modern visuals.
ðŸ“Œ Fetch API: For fetching real-time data from external APIs.
